This project uses an Arduino to control RGB LEDs through various functions. The code allows you to:

- Blink LEDs in a sequence
- Randomize LED colors
- Generate secondary colors by combining primary colors
- Produce random colors within the 16 million color range
- Increase and control the brightness of LEDs
